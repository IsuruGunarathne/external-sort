# folder based tracking of runs

small is a folder, inside it the list is stored as 'unsorted.txt' then the algorithm is recursively run, except this time, it's in the 'small directory' and the output is stored in 'sorted.txt'

large is a folder, inside it the list is stored as 'unsorted.txt' then the algorithm is recursively run, except this time, it's in the 'large directory' and the output is stored in 'sorted.txt'

after sorting small and large folders, write sorted.txt in small to sorted.txt in root, then write mid.txt, then write sorted.txt in large to sorted.txt in root.
